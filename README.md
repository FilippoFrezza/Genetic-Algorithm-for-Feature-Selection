# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Feature-Selection
This is one of the most powerful techniques for feature selection. 

NOTE: this algorithm optimizes for a GINI coefficient, reason for which the train and test set have to be of same length in order to compare TPR and FPR. However, this measure is customizable (don't optimize for GINI but optimize for something else).
